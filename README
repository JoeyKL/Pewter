A next-generation pure functional programming language.

Language Goals
--------------

The language should:

* be based on a small, consistent set of philosophical underpinnings, and eschew
  primitive implementations whenever possible.
* be general purpose, appropriate for any programming task.  
* be easily understood and written, both to those unfamiliar with the language
  and to those new to programming in general, and especially to those familiar
  with popular C-family languages such as C++, Java, and Swift.  
* be purely functional, with managed effects based on monads, and zero runtime
  exceptions (bar ones encoded into the type system).  
* encourage the programmer to program in a pure functional style as often as is
  appropriate.  
* allow the programmer to easily program in an object oriented style when
  appropriate.  
* allow and encourage the programmer to solve simple problems in the most
  intuitive way when there is no real benefit to more convoluted solutions.  
* have an extremely powerful and robust type system that serves the programmer
  and the tools that the programmer uses.  
* be type inferred, and have a type system that is simple to understand and
  unobtrusive.  
* have helpful, human readable error messages.  
* provide a powerful, safe, familiar, modular, enjoyable programming experience.
